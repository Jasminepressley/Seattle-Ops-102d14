Readings: Build a Computer

Below you will find some reading materials and videos that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.

1.Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
The choice between more cores or higher clock speed (frequency) in a CPU depends on the specific tasks and applications you plan to run on your computer.
There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as the ideal CPU configuration varies based on your needs. Here are some factors to consider:

  -Multi-Core CPUs: More cores are beneficial for tasks that can be parallelized or split into multiple threads. 
This includes many modern software applications, such as video editing, 3D rendering, scientific simulations, 
and some video games. With more cores, each core can handle a separate task, making these operations faster. 
In such cases, a multi-core CPU can provide a significant performance boost.

-Clock Speed: Higher clock speed is advantageous for tasks that are single-threaded or lightly threaded.
Many older applications and some video games are not optimized to take full advantage of multiple cores. 
In these cases, a CPU with a higher clock speed can offer better performance because it can execute a single thread faster.  

2.What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
-When choosing a motherboard for your processor, it's important to ensure compatibility and consider other factors to meet your specific needs. 
Here are the details to look for when finding a motherboard that fits your processor:
-Socket Compatibility, Chipset Compatibility, Form Factor, Memory Support, Expansion Slots, Storage Connectivity, I/O Ports and Connectors, Overclocking Support,
Network and Audio Features, VRM and Power Delivery, BIOS/UEFI Updates, Brand and Model, Price and Features  


3.What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
-When selecting a storage device, there are several tradeoffs to consider based on your specific needs and use cases. 
These tradeoffs typically involve factors such as speed, capacity, reliability, form factor, and cost. Here are the key tradeoffs to evaluate:
Storage Capacity, Speed and Performance, Reliability and Durability, Form Factor and Physical Size, Noise and Heat, Power ConsumptionPower Consumption
Cost, Endurance (for SSDs), Data Type and Usage, Redundancy and Backup


Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, 
in a way they’d best connect with?

-If I were to explain to someone with a similar background of mines the key parts of a computer I woud break-down these key componets:
Motherboard. The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. ...

CPU/processor:
  The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. 
  It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands.
  
RAM: 
  (Random Access Memory) RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed
  
Hard drive:
  The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. 
  The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
  
Power supply unit:
  The power supply unit in a computer converts the power from the wall outlet to the type of power needed by the computer. 
  It sends power through cables to the motherboard and other components.
  
Video card:
  The video card is responsible for what you see on the monitor. Most computers have a GPU (graphics processing unit) built into the motherboard instead of having a separate video card. 
  If you like playing graphics-intensive games, you can add a faster video card to one of the expansion slots to get better performance.

Network card:The network card allows your computer to communicate over a network and access the Internet. It can either connect with an Ethernet cable or through a wireless connection (often called Wi-Fi).
  Many motherboards have built-in network connections, and a network card can also be added to an expansion slot.

Bluetooth card (or adapter):Bluetooth is a technology for wireless communication over short distances. It's often used in computers to communicate with wireless keyboards, mice, and printers. 
  It's commonly built into the motherboard or included in a wireless network card.
