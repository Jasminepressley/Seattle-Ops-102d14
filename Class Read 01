## Readings: What is a Computer?

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

### How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
-A hardware hack and a software hack are two distinct approaches to exploiting or manipulating computer systems or electronic devices. 
They differ in their methods, targets, and consequences.

#### What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
There are two ways for spies to alter the guts of computer equipment. One, known as interdiction, consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer. 
This approach is favored by U.S. spy agencies, according to documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The other method involves seeding changes from the very beginning.

-Hardware Implants: Hardware implants involve the physical modification of a computer or its components to introduce malicious hardware devices or modifications. 
These implants are typically small and discreet and can be installed inside the computer or its peripherals. 
Common hardware implants include: Keyloggers, Hardware Trojans, Hardware Backdoors, Network Interface Cards (NIC) Alteration, Firmware Modifications

-Supply Chain Attacks: Instead of modifying the hardware directly, spies can also manipulate the hardware during the supply chain process. This can involve infiltrating the manufacturing, 
shipping, or distribution processes to introduce malicious components or modify existing hardware. Supply chain attacks can be very difficult to detect and may affect a large number of systems simultaneously.
These methods can be challenging to detect and defend against because they often require physical access to the target system or a sophisticated understanding of hardware design and manufacturing processes. 
Countermeasures against such attacks include robust supply chain security practices, regular hardware integrity checks, and advanced security monitoring to detect unusual hardware behavior or modifications.


##Explain how the hack worked.
-Investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.U.S. investigators found: The chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process, 
two officials say, by operatives from a unit of the People’s Liberation Army. 

-Nested on the servers’ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, 
sending a shudder through the intelligence community. Elemental’s servers could be found in Department of Defense data centers, the CIA’s drone operations, and the onboard networks of Navy warships. 
And Elemental was just one of hundreds of Supermicro customers.




##How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China. This was an third party /Amazon was unware un-athourized chihps being implated in devices.
