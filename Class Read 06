Fascinating history: What one home router can do - The WRT54GL

1.What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous?
It uses the 802.11g Wi-Fi standard, which has been surpassed by 802.11n and 802.11ac. It delivers data over the crowded 2.4GHz frequency band and is limited to speeds of 54Mbps. 
You can buy a new router—for less money—and get the benefit of modern standards, expansion into the 5GHz band, and data rates more than 20 times higher.
  
2.Given it’s age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?
  Why do people buy it? La Duca thinks big factors include the product's reliability, name recognition, and its support of open source firmware to unlock more advanced capabilities. 
  Users can easily replace the Linksys firmware with third-party tools like DD-WRT and OpenWrt, which were originally built for the company’s WRT54G routers more than a decade ago.
