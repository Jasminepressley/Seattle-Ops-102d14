Fascinating history: What one home router can do - The WRT54GL

1.What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous?
  It uses the 802.11g Wi-Fi standard, which has been surpassed by 802.11n and 802.11ac. It delivers data over the crowded 2.4GHz frequency band and is limited to speeds of 54Mbps. 
  You can buy a new router—for less money—and get the benefit of modern standards, expansion into the 5GHz band, and data rates more than 20 times higher.
  
2.Given it’s age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?
  Why do people buy it? La Duca thinks big factors include the product's reliability, name recognition, and its support of open source firmware to unlock more advanced capabilities. 
  Users can easily replace the Linksys firmware with third-party tools like DD-WRT and OpenWrt, which were originally built for the company’s WRT54G routers more than a decade ago.

3.What does the “WRT54GL” stand for in the name?
  The "L" is for "Linux." WRT stands for “Wireless RouTer," while 54 indicates the speed in Mbps and G is for 802.11g.
  
4.What did Linksys sell before routers?
  The company's first products were printer sharers that connected multiple PCs to printers.


5.When did Linksys preview their first consumer router?
Linksys previewed its first consumer router at the COMDEX computer industry conference in November 1999, 
before its official launch, but at the time was calling it an "Integrated Internet Hub."
  
  
6.Who suggested to name it a “router”?
  Bill Gates in 1999

7.What happened when Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform?
  Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform, making it very difficult to flash with open source firmware.
  After loud protests from customers, Linksys reissued a previous version of the WRT54G near the end of 2005 with the new name, WRT54GL, restoring Linux to its rightful place.
  There was also a 2008 lawsuit filed against Cisco by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), resulting from Cisco's failure to provide source code. 
  A settlement in 2009 led to Cisco complying with the GPL free software license and making a donation to the FSF.
  
8.Why doesn’t the WRT54GL model need to be modified to abide by the new FCC rules?
  The new FCC rules affect only the 5GHz band, so the WRT54GL didn't need to be modified.
  
9.Does the WRT54GL model still get updates from Linksys?
  WRT54GL still gets occasional software updates from Linksys. The most recent firmware update came out in January of this year to "address a manufacturing issue...
  [that] does not affect end users." Another firmware update in July 2015 fixed several security vulnerabilities.
  Linksys also offers support and a one-year warranty on new purchases of the WRT54GL, just as it does with its other products. 
"If you were to buy a 54GL today and you needed help setting it up, you could call our tech support and they'd help you set it up," La Duca said.
